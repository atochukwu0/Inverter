# Inverter
40kW, 600V, 3 phase inverter with FOC

This is my Electronics Engineering final project, a 40kW, 600V, 3 phase inverter. The goal is to design and implement a bidirectional power inverter that is fault-tolerant. The inverter will use Field-Oriented Control, and will be capable of operating in both sensored and sensorless modes, as well as having autotuning and testing features. The target power densities for the inverter are 50 kW/liter and 30 kW/kg, and it will be designed with a variety of control and power requirements in mind. A desktop application will be developed in C++ using Qt and Boost libraries, and will enable live plots, serial communication, and data logging for monitoring the inverter states.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) - C++ framework used for the desktop application
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) - C++ libraries used for the desktop application
